Title:- Installation and Configuration of virtualization using KVM.
Hardware requirement:- Desktop PC, Internet Connection
Software requirement:- Ubuntu 18.04 or above
Theory:-
KVM (for Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for Linux on x86 hardware containing virtualization extensions (Intel VT or AMD-V). It consists of a loadable kernel module, kvm.ko, that provides the core virtualization infrastructure and a processor specific module, kvm-intel.ko or kvm-amd.ko.
Using KVM, one can run multiple virtual machines running unmodified Linux or Windows images. Each virtual machine has private virtualized hardware: a network card, disk, graphics adapter, etc.
KVM is open source software. The kernel component of KVM is included in mainline Linux.
KVM converts Linux into a type-1 (bare-metal) hypervisor. All hypervisors need some operating system-level components—such as a memory manager, process scheduler, input/output (I/O) stack, device drivers, security manager, a network stack, and more—to run VMs. KVM has all these components because it’s part of the Linux kernel. Every VM is implemented as a regular Linux process, scheduled by the standard Linux scheduler, with dedicated virtual hardware like a network card, graphics adapter, CPU(s), memory, and disks.

Steps:-
1. Check whether virtualization is enabled. To check the status run following command -
sudo dmesg | grep kvm
If there is no output, then virtualization is enabled otherwise the feature must be enabled in the bios

2. Install the necessary packages
apt update
sudo apt install qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon-system virt-manager

3. Add current user to the libvirt group
sudo adduser $USER libvirt

4. Enable and start the libvirt service
sudo systemctl enable libvirtd.service --now

5. Log out of the desktop session and relogin

6. Open the Virtual Machine Manager app from the application tray, an option titled “QEMU/KVM” should appear
